# Serverless Guardrails Documentation

This folder captures reference documentation for the monorepo. Start with `DEMO.md` for the end-to-end walkthrough that demonstrates the scanner blocking an insecure deployment. Add design proposals, architecture decision records (ADRs), and configuration notes here as the project evolves.

Recommended structure:

- `DEMO.md` – scripted demo covering the failure and subsequent remediation.
- `adr/` – architecture decision records (e.g., ADR-0001-select-sam.md).
- `payloads/` – sample events, security reports, or replay files consumed by tests.

When adding new docs, update the table of contents below.

## Table of Contents
